          Thanks for visiting! As of today (Sep 7 2025) I'm continuing work on this site,
          so expect to see frequent-ish changes, The first of which being configuring a
          GitHub to coincide with it. check it out <a href="https://github.com/DinoSour69/dinosite">here</a>!
          For the time being, the rest of the site remains the same unless noted in the
          commits. Feel free to check out the sub-pages to learn a hint more about me. If
          you notice the repo hasn't been updated in a few days, feel free to yell at me
          about it on discord. @dinosour69
